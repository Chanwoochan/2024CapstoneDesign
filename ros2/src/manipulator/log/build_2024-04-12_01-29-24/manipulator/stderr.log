[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmotor_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "motor_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "motor_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    motor_interfaceConfig.cmake
    motor_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "motor_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "motor_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "motor_interface" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
